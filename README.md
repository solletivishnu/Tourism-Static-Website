# Tourism - Static Website

I have built a static website that appears beautifully on mobile screens. The Tourism website allows users to browse through curated content, videos, and images of popular destinations. Utilized tools and technologies such as HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to design an appealing and accessible user interface.

## Tired of:

- **Spending time** on poorly designed travel resources?

- **Juggling multiple websites** to explore destinations effectively?
